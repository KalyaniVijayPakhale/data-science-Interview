final aim: minimize the cost function
A cost function is a mathematical function used to measure the error or loss between predicted values and actual values in a machine learning model. The objective is to minimize the cost function during training to improve model performance.

2. mean absolute error
Common Cost Functions and Their Formulas
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Used in regression problems.
Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Used in regression problems.
Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

4. Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss)

Used in classification problems.
Measures the difference between actual and predicted probabilities for binary or multi-class classification.

5. Hinge Loss
Used in Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.

6. Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)
Often used in probabilistic models and classification tasks.

7. Regularized Loss

Combines a loss function with a regularization term to prevent overfitting.
Example (L2 Regularization):

8. Poisson Loss

Used for count data (e.g., predicting event counts).

9. Cosine Similarity Loss

Measures the cosine distance between actual and predicted vectors.

Regression: Use MSE, MAE, or Huber Loss.
Binary Classification: Use Cross-Entropy Loss or Hinge Loss.
Multi-Class Classification: Use Cross-Entropy Loss or KL Divergence.
Count Data: Use Poisson Loss.
Probabilistic Models: Use Negative Log-Likelihood or KL Divergence.
