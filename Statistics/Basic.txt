Statistics:
    1. Descriptive: Organizing nad summarizing data
        Central tendancy - mean, median, mode
        Measure of dipursion - variance, std deviation\

    2. Inferential: Predict conclusion, inferences using sample data
        z-test, t-test
    
    population and sample

    mean of uniform distribution: (a+b)/2
    
    st deviation: summation((x-x^))/N

Percentile: A value below which certain percentage of observation lie.
np/100

Probability: determine the likelihood of an event
Addition rule: mutually excusive event

Central Limit Theorem:
Sampling distribution of mean always be normally distributed, as long as sample size is large enough.

Regardless of whether the population has a normal, poisson, binomial, and other distribution,
the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.
