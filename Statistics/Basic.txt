Statistics:
    1. Descriptive: Organizing nad summarizing data
        Central tendancy - mean, median, mode
        Measure of dipursion - variance, std deviation\

    2. Inferential: Predict conclusion, inferences using sample data
        z-test, t-test
    
    population and sample

    mean of uniform distribution: (a+b)/2
    
    st deviation: summation((x-x^))/N

Percentile: A value below which certain percentage of observation lie.
np/100

Probability: determine the likelihood of an event
Addition rule: mutually excusive event

Central Limit Theorem:
Sampling distribution of mean always be normally distributed, as long as sample size is large enough.

Regardless of whether the population has a normal, poisson, binomial, and other distribution,
the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.


skewness: Direction of the distribution curve
left side - Positive
right side - Negative
middle - no Skewness

Kurtosis: height of the curve

Independant probability: If two events A & B are set to be Independant if occurance of A doesnt depend on occurance of B 

Conditional Probability: probability of haappening event A depends on probability of happening another evebt b
P(B/A) = P(A and B)/P(A)

Bayes theorem: 
P(A/B) = P(A and B)/P(B)

Poison distribution =  if randon varaibale takes value from 0 to infinity

Normal distribution = if its density curve is bell shaped and the curve is symmetric in nature
